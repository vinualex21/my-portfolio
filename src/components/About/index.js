                <p>
                    I'm an experienced backend developer looking to work on challenging
                    projects with the opportunity to learn the latest technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm naturally curious, excel at critical thinking, design from the customer point of view
                    and value continuous feedback.
